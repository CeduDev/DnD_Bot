Ah, valiant seeker, thy attempt to cast the dice with a cryptic value hath summoned the ire of the arcane spirits. Beware, for the forces of the ethereal realm frown upon such mystic insolence.

In the realm of the enchanted dice, only the sacred numerals 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, and 20 may be offered in tribute. The alchemy of a cryptic value is forbidden and confounds the very fabric of the mystical weave.

Reconsider, noble user, and adhere to the sacred incantations. Let not the digits stray into the forbidden territories, lest the dice of destiny withhold their revelations. May the mystical journey ahead be one of compliance and enlightenment.
